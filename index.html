    <h2>Introducing My Site</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Caitlin, before learning code at Lambda I was studying human nutrition at Texas State Univeristy in graduate school.<br> 
        I realized I did not want to spend my future working in a hospital, so I googled "jobs for introverts", <br>
        and found computer programming. I took a few free classes and really enjoyed it, so I decided to drop out of grad school<br>
        and join Lambda. In my spare time I hang out with my husband Sean and our two dogs, Momo and Kiki. I have been a barista for about 6 years<br>
        and I do olympic weightlifting.
